When dealing with classes, you can have variables that are
available everywhere (global variables), variables that are
only available to members of a certain class (member variables),
and variables that are only available to particular instances of
a class (instance variables).

The same goes for functions: some are available everywhere,
some are only available to members of a certain class, and still
others are only available to particular instance objects.
